I was driving in my Porsche to Raesfeld one sunny day.
As I drove down the hauptstrasse, I spotted the most adorable couple walkingalongside the road, dressed in lederhosen and a dirndel.
They looked to be headed to a biergarten, and I was envious, for I was hungry and could go for a bratwurst.
But my plans were disrupted by a parade crossing the road, bearing what had to be the world's largest apfelkuchen.
So instead, I turned around and made my way to a small Backerei I happened upon a few minutes ago.
Unfortunately, as I was turning, I scraped the side of a BMW parked on the side of the Haupstrasse.
Finally I arrived at the Backerei but they were out of Brot and I was as angry as I was hungry.
To cool my anger, I sat in my Porsche with the klimaanlage on, until I heard someone tapping on my window...
