I was driving in my Porsche to Raesfeld one sunny day.
As I drove down the hauptstrasse, I spotted the most adorable couple walkingalongside the road, dressed in lederhosen and a dirndel.
They looked to be headed to a biergarten, and I was envious, for I was hungry and could go for a bratwurst.
But my plans were disrupted by a parade crossing the road, bearing what had to be the world's largest apfelkuchen.
So instead, I turned around and made my way to a small Backerei I happened upon a few minutes ago.
Unfortunately, as I was turning, I scraped the side of a BMW parked on the side of the Haupstrasse.
Finally I arrived at the Backerei but they were out of Brot and I was as angry as I was hungry.
To cool my anger, I sat in my Porsche with the klimaanlage on, until I heard someone tapping on my window...
To my surprise it was a woman holding Brot and Bratwurst and smiling as she offered me some.
I immediately noticed she was the person at the parade bearing the world's largest apfelkuchen.
I eingef√ºhrt myself and said that it was nice to meet her, we ate the essen and enjoyed the rest of the parade.
The End.
Or so we thought, as the Mehlhase appeared and transformed into Doener.
